I’m Dr. Zhibin Gao, a specially appointed Researcher and Doctoral Supervisor at the School of Materials Science and Engineering, Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU), China. I am also affiliated with the State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials. Prior to joining XJTU, I served as a Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore (2019–2021) and a Research Scholar at Michigan State University (2017–2018). I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from Tongji University in 2018.</p> <p>My research bridges materials science and artificial intelligence, where I develop physics-informed machine learning approaches for computational materials design. My goal is to accelerate the discovery and optimization of micro/nano-structured functional materials with tailored mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. Currently, my group focuses on three key areas: (1) high-throughput design of novel nuclear fuels and structural materials, (2) thermal transport and management in micro/nanomaterials, and (3) heat dissipation solutions for semiconductor chips in electronic devices.</p> <p>I have been honored with several awards, including the Shaanxi Provincial Young 1000 Talent, the Young Talent Support Program by Xi’an Association for Science and Technology, and the XJTU Young Top-notch Talent Program (Category B). I also serve as a Youth Editorial Board Member for the Journal of Materials Informatics. My work has led to publications in peer-reviewed journals such as Materials</p> </body></html>
